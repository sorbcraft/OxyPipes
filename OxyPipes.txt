As the patient inhales, a magnetic valve opens for a specified short interval of time (e.g. 3 seconds, calculated by a microcontroller), allowing a known volume of oxygen (e.g. 300 ml) from a pressurized source to pass. When passing through a venturi ejector, the oxygen draws a fraction of ambient air, set by a manual valve, and then continues its way into a reservoir volume of 30 liters. Adding half a liter of gas will increase the pressure in the reservoir about 15 mbar. After some more seconds, as the patient exhales, a second solenoid valve opens to couple the reservoiur to a PEEP valve set to the peep pressure. Flow and pressure sensors, a safety valve and backflow stops are included in the required positions.

Alternative controll cycles may be realized by a blinking circuit, a mechanical oszillator or a pneumatic oszillator. For each of them the swictching intervals and times can be adjusted by the according means, e.g. slides, potentiometers or valves. Switching of the valves can be triggered by inputs from a differential pressure sensitive switch.
